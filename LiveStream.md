Freedom Voting Machines open-source live coding 3: GitHub Workspace

This is our first Milestone. In this Milestone, we are setting up the GitHub workspace and adding instructions for volunteers to contribute research and existing voting machine documentation via a OneDrive, Google Drive, etc link.
